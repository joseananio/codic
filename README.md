# codic

Codic is a simple node based library. The goal is to allow creating schedules that work with any database, through drivers.

Anyone can write a driver for any database or storage mechanism to work with Codic in managing schedules.

Currently, we support redis and in-memory storage of schedules. Contributions are welcome. We will soon publish more details on how to contribute. Now, you can just contact me.
